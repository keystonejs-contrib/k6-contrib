# Example Project - Kilt Auth

This project implements a basic Keystone app, with `Users`.

You can use it as a starting place for using DID authorization with Kilt Protocol.

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Keystone repository locally then navigate to this directory and run:

```shell
yarn dev
```

This will start the Admin UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
First time you log in you will be asked to create the first user.
You can use the Admin UI to create items in your database.

You can also access a GraphQL Playground at [localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql), which allows you to directly run GraphQL queries and mutations.

ðŸš€ Congratulations, you're now up and running with Keystone with DID auth!
