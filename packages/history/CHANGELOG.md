  There are some breaking changes in line with the Keystone breaking changes

  ### notable changes

  - No longer have `isRequired` field on file and image type (azure, s3).
  - `defaultValue` is now static value for each field type, need to use resolveInput and other hooks to generate default value.
  - `isRequired` is moved to `validation.isRequired` in line with keystone.
  - `atTracking` now internally uses the default value `{kind: 'now'}` and `db.updatedAt` option on `timestamp` field instead of hooks.
